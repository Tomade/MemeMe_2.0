## MemeMe 2.0

My implementation of the MemeMe project 2.0 for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree.

In addition to satisfying the requirements listed in the rubric, we also implement 
zoom/pan with standard gestures by means of a UIScrollView embedding the UIIMageView.  
Pictures are initially placed inside the scroll view by programmatically changing the 
autolayout constraints between the UIIMageView and the UIScrollView.

For full credit, we also provide "Delete" and "Edit" buttons in detail view.
