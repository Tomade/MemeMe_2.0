## MemeMe 1.0

My implementation of the MemeMe project 1.0 for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree.

In addition to satisfying the requirements listed in the rubric, we also implement 
zoom/pan with standard gestures by means of a UIScrollView embedding the UIIMageView.  
Pictures are initially placed inside the scroll view by programmatically changing the 
autolayout constraints between the UIIMageView and the UIScrollView.
